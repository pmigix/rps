# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

In this assignment we have to implement the "rock paper scissors" game.

The game is playable only through the browser console so for that reason I've set up some input validation to not let the player enter whatever they want.<br>Valid input examples: "rock", "RoCk", "ROCK", "R", "r"
