# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

In this assignment we have to implement the "rock paper scissors" game.

~~The game is playable only through the browser console so for that reason I've set up some input validation to not let the player enter whatever they want.<br>Valid input examples: "rock", "RoCk", "ROCK", "R", "r"~~

## New changes

- Instead of prompts, buttons have been added for each option

- Scores and messages get displayed on the screen
